# Intro-To-AI-Modified-Sodoko

This project is based on simple backtracking algorithm to solve
a modified version of sudoko(colored with priorities).
Uses two heuristic to determine the ones with high probabilty of
failure:
* MRV(Minimum Remaining Value)
* Degree

Also uses forward checking to check and eliminate illegal values
from variable domains.
